          <h3>Log Data</h3>
          <p>
            We want to inform you that whenever you use our Software, in a case
            of an error in the app we collect data and information (through
            third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data
            may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP")
            address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of
            the app when utilizing our Software, the time and date of your use
            of the Software, and other statistics.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used
            as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from
            the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
            memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            This Software does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the
            app may use third party code and libraries that use "cookies" to
            collect information and improve their services. You have the option
            to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is
            being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you
            may not be able to use some portions of this Software.
          </p>

          <h3>Service Providers</h3>
          <p>
            We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the
            following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Software;</li>
            <li>To provide the Software on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Software-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Software is used.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We want to inform users of this Software that these third parties
            have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform
            the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are
            obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other
            purpose.
          </p>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus
            we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting
            it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet,
            or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we
            cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>

          <h3>Photo Processing</h3>
          <p>
            When users apply AI effects in Dreamify, the selected photo is sent
            securely to our servers for temporary processing. As part of this
            process, the photo may be shared with trusted third-party AI
            providers, specifically Google Gemini API and Replicate API, solely
            for the purpose of generating the requested effects. The photo is
            used only momentarily during processing and is not stored or
            retained afterward. No photo data is used for training purposes or
            shared beyond the processing task.
          </p>

          <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
          <p>
            This Software may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
            third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
            external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise
            you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no
            control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
            policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
          </p>

          <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            This Software does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
            knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
            under 13 years of age. In the case we discover that a child under 13
            has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete
            this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are
            aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
            please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.
          </p>

          <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are
            advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will

            page.

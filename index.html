            third-party AI services (specifically Google Gemini API and
            Replicate API).
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Your prompts and any uploaded/selected images may be sent securely
              to these third-party services for processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              This data is used solely to generate the resulting image based on
              your request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data is typically processed ephemerally and is not stored or
              retained by us or our third-party AI partners after processing,
              nor is it used for training their models, unless explicitly stated
              otherwise in their respective privacy policies.

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Data Retention</h3>
          <p>

              behalf and require access to such information to do that work
              (e.g., AI service providers Google Gemini API and Replicate API
              for image generation, cloud hosting providers). These third
              parties are obligated to protect your data and use it only for the

              process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our
              policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of
              others, we may share your information as permitted or required by
              any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
            </li>

            do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
            children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected
            personal information from a child under age 13 without verification
            of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from
            our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that
            your child has provided us with personal information, please contact
            us so that we can take necessary actions.

            You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
            changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are
            posted.
